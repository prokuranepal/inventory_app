# Introduction to Inventory Management System
Inventory Management System is a cross platform mobile application based on React Native. Its primary function is to store and manage the inventory specifically medicines in the remote health posts of a country. A user can add, update, delete and display the inventory. A user can also add medicines to a cart and order them from the central distribution center. There is also a QR code scanner to quickly scan the incoming package and add it to the inventory. The user can order the items via call or messages or over internet.
